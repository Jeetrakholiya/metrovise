## ⚡ 1-Time Supabase Cloud Database Setup (Zero Config for End Users)

> 💡 **You ONLY configure this once as the platform owner.** Your customers, agency owners, and staff members **NEVER** need to know about Supabase or enter any keys.

### Step 1: Get Your Free Supabase Credentials (60 Seconds)
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free project.
2. In your Supabase Dashboard, go to **Project Settings > API** to find your:
   - **Project URL** (e.g. `https://xyzcompany.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public API Key** (e.g. `eyJhbGciOi...`)

### Step 2: Run the SQL Tables Script
1. In your Supabase Dashboard, click **SQL Editor** > **New Query**.
2. Copy and paste the contents of [`supabase_schema.sql`](file:///a:/AccountiX/supabase_schema.sql).
3. Click **Run** to generate all persistent tables and RLS security policies.

### Step 3: Add to Vercel (Automatic for All Users Worldwide)
1. Open your **Vercel Dashboard** > **Project Settings** > **Environment Variables**.
2. Add these 2 variables:
   - `SUPABASE_URL` = `https://xyzcompany.supabase.co`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = `your_anon_key_here`
3. Click **Save** and **Redeploy**.
4. **THAT'S IT!** Now every single user, phone, and laptop that opens AccountiX automatically connects to your shared database with **zero configuration required!**

### 2. Switching Themes
- Click the **`☀️ / 🌙`** toggle button on the top navigation bar or go to **Settings**.
- Supports **Executive Obsidian (Dark Mode)** and **Clean Slate (Official Light Mode)**.

### 3. Transitioning to Live Production Mode
When you are ready to onboard real clients:
1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Under **🚀 Production Launch Controls**, click **`🧹 Start Clean Production Database`**.
3. This clears all demo clients, leads, and deliverables while preserving your team roster, rate card, and Supabase cloud connection.
